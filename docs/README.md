# Arist Page - SAWYL

## Goals for project
Every modern artist needs to have an online presence. It is a fantastic way to keep fans up to date with your work, whether it be new music, tour dates, or merchandise. It can also be a great way for fans, or potential clients, to get in touch.

Here I have created a web page for the fictional artist "SAWYL". This is a place for this artist to display all of their music, merchandise and tour dates; along with a contact form for any fans or clients to get in touch.

Thank you for visiting my project - if you have any questions please feel to contact me via my GitHub contact details.
